# Introduction 


The purpose of this lab is to explore the different processes of testing and bug tracking of a software system. Bug/Defect testing involves a SUT, defect tracking system, exploratory testing, manual scripting testing,and regression testing. For this lab the SUT(System Under Test) was a simple ATM/Card Transaction App while the defect tracking system that was used was Github Issues. 


For the exploratory testing, each pair of team members thought of test cases on the fly and did not have a script or list of test cases going into the testing session. This produced many test cases but they were random and scattered as each team member will have a different thought process and technique of testing the app functions. Although the results were more scattered, exploratory testing offered more freedom for the tester to go as deep as they wanted (depth vs breadth) when testing functionalities. As for the manual functional testing, there was more structure (a tabular list of test cases) so the results were transparent before even starting the testing phase. After inputting the bugs into Github Issues, it was seen that a large amount of test cases for the manual functional testing was already covered in the exploratory testing. The regression testing was tested on a new version of the ATM app so the results/process did not clash as much with the previous testing methods. After regression testing, 11 bugs/issues were closed and 9 were still open. No new bugs were found during the regression testing period of Version 1.1 of the App.


The group’s general knowledge about the types and process of testing was very limited before the completion of the lab. An false assumption made was that manual testing involved no planning and was randomly tested by one person until all the bugs were caught. This description is more closely related to exploratory testing than manual functional testing. Prior to this lab the difference between the two types of testing was not very clear.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan 


The exploratory testing plan involved having 5 main functionalities of the ATM system as the functional structure for the tester to follow.


1)Balance Inquiry
2)Withdrawal
3)Deposit
4)Transfer
5)Login


Exploratory testing is an unscripted testing process where the tester will come up with most of the test cases, test design, and execution as the application is being tested. Along with the 5 major functions to be tested, the exploratory testing plan included the general approach to be taken when testing a function. This approach set a basic guideline for the team members to follow for a more streamlined and consistent testing process. The approach for testing a function was to test each/all functions of the application with a limited number of repetitions/combinations. An example is when testing the “Deposit” functionality, the tester will test if the deposit will work for each account(Checking, Saving etc) but after a “Transfer” has been done for one of the accounts. Checking for co-dependence of a function to another function was not in the scope of the exploratory testing plan and would have exceeded the time limit of the testing process. Realistic numbers were chosen as well for test inputs (non-negative, integer numbers etc).


The two pairs of team members used a different card number to use for testing the ATM application. The two different bank cards had different accounts, settings, passwords etc. This helped to divide the functionalities between the groups to test similar test cases with a different baseline. The plan of how a tester was to come up with test cases was to use tests with common paths. The testers would input realistic numbers that a real ATM user would use. An example is when testing the “Deposit” functionality, the test will deposit $20 as opposed to an infinitely large sum like $99999999999999999. Capping the exploratory testing process to half an hour helped to make sure that all 5 main functionalities were covered instead of testing for random anomalies and combinations which would’ve taken significantly longer to do.



# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Both the manual functional testing and the exploratory testing were useful testing methods for this project. However, all of the defects found with exploratory testing, were also found with manual functional testing. Meanwhile, manual functional testing found a couple unique defects that were not discovered through exploratory testing.


The manual functional testing was a more thorough testing experience than the exploratory testing. This was mainly due to the difference in volume of test cases performed during the exploratory testing in comparison to the manual functional testing. Exploratory testing was limited to 30 minutes, which resulted in 35 test cases run. A total of 40 test cases were run during manual functional testing. 


There are a couple manual function test cases that were very broad and provided a lot of freedom for the user to test. For example, test case #8 for the manual functional testing checks to see if any action can be performed successfully. The test case does not specify any specific action, instead, the user can pick any action and check if successful. This broad style of test case was not ever used during the exploratory functional testing. During exploratory testing, each test case was very specific in the action being tested and contained clear instructions on steps to take during each specific test. The broad test case style has the potential to miss a defect if the user tests a specific transaction but not another. However, the manual functional testing makes up for the lack of detail in test case #8 by running a lot of additional test cases (40 test cases). 


One main difference between the exploratory testing and the manual functional testing is the functional repetition performed during manual functional testing. There was minimal functional repetition performed during exploratory testing. Only proper inputs were tested and each function was only tested once. For example, improper card pin or insufficient balance checks were not tested during exploratory testing. Only the correct card pin and sufficient balance checks were tested. Due to the 30 minute exploratory testing limit, the exploratory testing plan was defined in a way to minimize extensive testing and prioritize a general test of all major functions. Manual functional testing contained a lot more extensive tests; for example, checking invalid pin extension for five separate test cases. Overall, a longer and more extensive testing method will find more defects as long as all major functions are still being tested.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports


The group came to a consensus and followed the outline of the following to include in the defect reports: the function being tested, the initial state of the system, detailed steps to reproduce the bug/defect, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome. With a descriptive title, and using the above points as headers in the report, there is clarity and consistency when interpreting the issues for the developers and support team to understand and effectively address the bugs. The language remains objective to not place blame or criticize, and the descriptions are clear for the issues to be reproduced. The communication in the defect reports are effective in allowing the tester and the developer to work as a team to resolve the issues. When the issues were addressed, the defect reports were also updated with detailed comments (and closed if resolved) to continue the process of team communication.


# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided


Each member of the group first familiarized themselves with the scope of the assignment and the high level requirements of the ATM simulation program. The group discussed possible features of the system to test. During the exploratory testing phase the group was split into two pairs, Nic and Shawn using Card 1, and Nick and Tania using Card 2. Given half an hour for exploratory testing, one member of each pair performed tests on the program (Shawn and Nick) while the other member of the pair documented the process (Nic and Tania) of system state, input, expected output, and actual output. After regrouping, the discovered defects were compared and compiled into a set of unique defects and divided into an equal number for each member to submit. The defects were submitted into the Issue Tracking System (GitHub Issues) to create the Defect Report.


Manual scripted tested was performed as a group on Version 1.0, following the test suite outlined in Appendix C of the assignment manual. Shawn performed the tests while the rest of the group members instructed him on the detailed steps, recorded outcomes, and created issues to submit to the Defect Report.


For regression testing, the group retested the issues initially submitted and updated the defects as resolved/closed, or in-progress/open with detailed comments on the outcomes.


A second manual scripted testing was performed as a group on Version 1.1, again following the test suite outlined in Appendix C. Again, Shawn performed the tests while the remaining group members were responsible for documentation.


# Lessons Learned from your teamwork

One insight gathered during exploratory testing was that different team members may have different perspectives and ways of thinking about the SUT. This can lead to a variety of different tests being done, and as a result better test coverage, which is ultimately a positive thing. Certain team members may be able to think of test cases that others would not have. For example, Nick tested the bank card number of ‘3’ during exploratory testing which uncovered a bug which froze version 1.0 of the ATM system. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Most difficulties arose from not having used the issues feature of GitHub in the past, and was mostly a familiarity challenge which was quickly overcome with some research and experimentation. There were also some initial difficulties trying to understand how to properly configure the GitHub with all of the team members, however after a small amount of research this was also resolved. 

A lesson we learned was that exploratory testing gives users more flexibility when testing the system, but at the expense of structure. Even though we found many of the bugs during initial exploratory testing, we still found new ones in the scripted testing that wouldn’t have been found if only exploratory testing was done. Since exploratory testing has no script, it is harder to define test coverage with this type of testing. This is why it’s important to have a high-level plan of what should be covered when initiating exploratory testing.

We also learned the importance of regression testing to ensure that existing bugs are rectified. Not only is it important to test the previous bugs found, it is also important to re-do the scripted testing set, to ensure that no new bugs are created unintentionally by trying to fix prior bugs. We did not find any new bugs created, however it is very possible a 1.2 version could re-introduce new bugs by fixing bugs from 1.1.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

This was a good lab to be introduced to the different types of testing, and also learning how to use GitHub issues. The lab instructions were detailed enough to give the team direction on how to complete the lab, and the rubric/report structure provided a straightforward way to structure the report.
